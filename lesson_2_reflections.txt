What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When a git repository is initialized a hidden folder which will contain the commits will be created. This file will hold the information that git needs in order to store commits as well as allowing for branches and other commands. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a temporary holding ground for files that the user is interested in committing. The value is that multiple files can be placed in the staging area, alloweing for specific choices in which files to commit and allowing the user to double check his or her actions.
