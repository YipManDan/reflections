When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to share your code or work with other collaborators. Or when you want a means of backing up your code to the cloud.
Other options are if you want to work on the code from different computers.

Why might you always want to pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository.

You may be working on something that is not ready to be merged with newly pushed code.
